# Agentic Investigator with Internal Knowledge Base

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the autonomous Kubernetes investigation system with an **AI-powered agentic investigator** that uses **company-specific internal knowledge** to generate intelligent solutions.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Core Principle: **Non-Breaking Additive Enhancement**
- ✅ **Preserve existing deterministic investigator** (already committed and working)
- ✅ **Add new agentic capabilities** alongside existing functionality  
- ✅ **Create new files and components** rather than modifying existing code
- ✅ **Duplicate logic where needed** to avoid breaking existing demos

### System Architecture
```
Existing (Preserved):
├── autonomous_monitor.py           # Existing - will only ADD agentic option
├── agents/deterministic_investigator.py  # Existing - NO CHANGES
├── agents/base_investigator.py     # Existing - NO CHANGES
└── agents/tools/                   # Existing - NO CHANGES

New (Additive):
├── internal_knowledge/             # NEW: AcmeCorp knowledge base
│   ├── acmecorp_standards.md
│   ├── approved_resources.md
│   ├── incident_playbook.md
│   └── resource_policies.md
├── agents/knowledge/               # NEW: Knowledge engine
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── knowledge_engine.py
├── agents/agentic_investigator_v2.py  # NEW: Enhanced agentic investigator
└── docs/AGENTIC_DEMO_TUTORIAL.md   # NEW: Demo instructions
```

## 📋 Implementation Plan - Chunk by Chunk

### **CHUNK 1: Create Internal Knowledge Base (15 minutes)**
**Goal**: Create AcmeCorp company-specific knowledge documents

**Files to Create**:
- `api/internal_knowledge/acmecorp_standards.md`
- `api/internal_knowledge/approved_resources.md`  
- `api/internal_knowledge/incident_playbook.md`
- `api/internal_knowledge/resource_policies.md`

**Content Strategy**:
- Company-specific deployment standards
- Approved container images and versions
- Standard resource allocation policies
- Step-by-step incident response procedures
- Internal troubleshooting guidelines

**Validation**: Knowledge documents exist and contain realistic company policies

---

### **CHUNK 2: Build Knowledge Engine (20 minutes)**
**Goal**: Create intelligent knowledge retrieval system

**Files to Create**:
- `api/agents/knowledge/__init__.py`
- `api/agents/knowledge/knowledge_engine.py`

**Features**:
- Load and parse markdown knowledge documents
- Smart text matching for issue-relevant knowledge
- Extract specific sections based on issue classification
- Return contextual knowledge for AI reasoning

**Validation**: Knowledge engine can load docs and return relevant sections

---

### **CHUNK 3: Enhanced Agentic Investigator (25 minutes)**
**Goal**: Create AI-powered investigator with knowledge integration

**Files to Create**:
- `api/agents/agentic_investigator_v2.py` (NEW file, don't modify existing)

**Features**:
- Fix missing `_investigate()` abstract method
- AI-powered issue classification
- Knowledge-based solution generation
- Company-compliant recommendations
- Integration with Google ADK

**Validation**: Agentic investigator runs without errors and generates solutions

---

### **CHUNK 4: Integration & Testing (15 minutes)**
**Goal**: Integrate with autonomous monitor and test end-to-end

**Files to Modify** (Safely):
- `api/autonomous_monitor.py` - ADD option to use agentic investigator
- `api/app/routers/investigation.py` - ADD new agentic v2 endpoint

**Features**:
- Option to alternate between deterministic and agentic investigators
- New API endpoint for agentic v2 investigation
- Enhanced reporting with AI solutions

**Validation**: Both deterministic and agentic demos work independently

---

### **CHUNK 5: Demo Documentation (10 minutes)**
**Goal**: Create comprehensive demo tutorial

**Files to Create**:
- `docs/AGENTIC_DEMO_TUTORIAL.md`

**Content**:
- How to test deterministic vs agentic investigators
- Expected outputs and differences
- API endpoint usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide

**Validation**: Demo instructions are clear and functional

## 🎯 Expected Demo Flow

### **Deterministic Investigation** (Existing - Preserved)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start monitoring (deterministic mode)
docker exec -it k8s-agentic-swarm-command-center-main bash -c "cd /root/api && python3 autonomous_monitor.py --mode deterministic"

# Terminal 2: Introduce issues
docker exec -it k8s-agentic-swarm-command-center-main bash -c "./deploy-demo-apps.sh"

# Result: Systematic 9-step investigation with structured findings
```

### **Agentic Investigation** (New - Enhanced)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start monitoring (agentic mode)  
docker exec -it k8s-agentic-swarm-command-center-main bash -c "cd /root/api && python3 autonomous_monitor.py --mode agentic"

# Terminal 2: Introduce issues
docker exec -it k8s-agentic-swarm-command-center-main bash -c "./deploy-demo-apps.sh"

# Result: AI-driven investigation with company-specific solutions
```

### **Expected Output Differences**

**Deterministic Output**:
```
🔍 Step 3: Analyzing pod states...
❌ Found pod in ImagePullBackOff state
📋 Recommendation: Check image name and registry access
```

**Agentic Output**:
```
🧠 AI Agent investigating ImagePullBackOff...
🔍 Issue Classification: Critical image violation - immediate action needed
📚 Consulting AcmeCorp Approved Resources documentation...
💡 AI Solution: Image 'nginx:nonexistent-tag' violates AcmeCorp policy
📋 Company Fix: Update to approved 'harbor.acmecorp.com/frontend/nginx:1.27.1'
⚡ Command: kubectl set image deployment/broken-image-app broken-app=harbor.acmecorp.com/frontend/nginx:1.27.1
📖 Reference: AcmeCorp Standards Section 2.1 - Container Image Policy
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Non-Breaking Guarantees

### **Existing Code Protection**
- ✅ No modifications to `deterministic_investigator.py`
- ✅ No modifications to `base_investigator.py`
- ✅ No modifications to existing tool wrappers
- ✅ Autonomous monitor only ADDS agentic option, doesn't change existing behavior

### **Rollback Strategy**
If anything breaks:
1. Remove new `agentic_investigator_v2.py` file
2. Remove `internal_knowledge/` directory
3. Remove `agents/knowledge/` directory
4. Revert any small additions to `autonomous_monitor.py`
5. Existing deterministic demo continues working perfectly

### **Testing Strategy**
- Test deterministic functionality after each chunk
- Test agentic functionality independently
- Verify API endpoints work for both modes
- Confirm container rebuilds don't break existing features

## 🚀 Success Metrics

### **Chunk 1 Success**: Knowledge base documents exist and contain realistic company policies
### **Chunk 2 Success**: Knowledge engine loads docs and returns relevant sections  
### **Chunk 3 Success**: Agentic investigator runs and generates AI solutions
### **Chunk 4 Success**: Both investigation modes work independently
### **Chunk 5 Success**: Demo documentation is complete and functional

## 🎯 Final Demo Value

**Deterministic Demo**: Shows systematic, reliable, rule-based investigation
**Agentic Demo**: Shows AI intelligence, company-aware solutions, adaptive reasoning

**Combined Value**: Demonstrates both traditional automation AND cutting-edge AI approaches to infrastructure management!
